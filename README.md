Project Description:
This website is designed for movie lovers. Based on user-selected interests and the year of release, it suggests movies accordingly. The fun twist? If you select horror, it might show you a romantic film; choose thriller, and you could get a comedy—intentionally mismatched for a playful experience!

The Problem (that doesn't exist):
Suggest movies not accoring to their wishes.Annoys people.

[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!] :
 To annoy the user, the site intentionally shows mismatched movie suggestions. For example, if they select horror, it might display romantic comedies instead.
